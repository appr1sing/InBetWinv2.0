InBetWin v2.0! (Still-in-progress, estimated completion: 40%)

- This is our entry from the last Google DevFest NYC Hackathon that was not finished. I'm currently rebuilding it from the ground up as my personal project.


A simple multiplayer card game in which the only thing you need to do is to guess the dealer's card if it's in between your two cards. 

- Used Facebook API to have users to play the game. 
- Used Firebase Authentication. 
- Utilized Firebase Realtime Database for handling events and game mechanics.
